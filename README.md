I conducted a full technical SEO audit to identify issues and opportunities for improvement. The audit covered:  
✅ Website Crawlability & Indexing  
✅ Page Speed & Core Web Vitals  
✅ Mobile Friendliness  
✅ On-page SEO (Meta tags, Headers, Internal Linking)  
✅ Site Architecture & URL Structure  
✅ XML Sitemap & Robots.txt Validation  
✅ Structured Data & Schema Markup  
✅ Broken Links & Redirects  
✅ Security (HTTPS & Mixed Content)  

 I documented my findings in a detailed report with actionable recommendations to improve site performance, search visibility, and user experience.  

 **Key learning:** Technical SEO is the backbone of organic growth – even small fixes can significantly impact traffic and rankings.
